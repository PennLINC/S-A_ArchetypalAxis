# The Archetypal Sensorimotor-Association Axis

The archetypal sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis from **Neurodevelopment of the association cortices: Patterns, mechanisms, and implications for psychopathology, Sydnor et al., 2021, Neuron https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.06.016** is provided in Glasser360 and Schaefer400 parcellations as well as in fslr (HCP) and fsaverage5 surface vertices. Please cite Sydnor et al., 2021 if you use S-A axis rankings in your work.**

Sensorimotor-Association axis rankings can be found for each atlas (Glasser360, Schaefer400, FSLR, FSaverage) in $atlas/Sensorimotor_Association_Axis_AverageRanks.csv. Raw data from the 10 cortical features used to create the S-A axis rankings can additionally be found in $atlas/brainmaps_$atlas.csv 

Please see https://pennlinc.github.io/S-A_ArchetypalAxis/ for full documentation, including descriptions of S-A axis image and csv files, accompanying cortical maps (and references), and code.
