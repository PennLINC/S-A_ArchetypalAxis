# The Archetypal Sensorimotor-Association Axis

**The archetypal sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis from "Neurodevelopment of the association cortices: Patterns, mechanisms, and implications for psychopathology", Sydnor et al., 2021, Neuron https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.06.016 is provided in Glasser360 and Schaefer400 parcellations as well as in fslr (HCP) and fsaverage5 surface vertices. Please cite this work if you use the S-A axis rankings provided in Sensorimotor_Association_Axis_AverageRanks.csv.**

- Raw data for the 10 cortical features can be found in $atlas/brainmaps_$atlas.csv 
- Sensorimotor-Association axis rankings can be found in $atlas/Sensorimotor_Association_Axis_AverageRanks.csv

Please see https://pennlinc.github.io/S-A_ArchetypalAxis/ for full documentation, including descriptions of S-A axis image and csv files, accompanying cortical maps (and references), and code.
